# COVID-19 Studies

This repository contains R and Python scripts used in COVID-19 epidemiologic and clinical research. It supports data preprocessing, cohort construction, 1:1 matching, Cox proportional hazards modeling, and creation of descriptive summary tables (e.g., Table 1). Additional modules include negative binomial regression for incidence rate analysis, Nelson–Aalen cumulative hazard plots, and multivariable Andersen–Gill Cox models with inverse probability weighting (IPW). Scripts are designed to be adaptable for study-specific covariates and weighting approaches.
